# src/components

The components directory should hold components that are intended for use throughout the application. Typically, each component should have its own directory, including a general component file along with its associated styles

```
src
└── components
        ├── demo
        │   ├── Demo.tsx
        │   └── Demo.scss
        └── example
            ├── Example.tsx
            └── Example.scss
```

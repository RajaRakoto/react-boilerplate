---

### 📌 Using 

To use this template, use the following commands:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash # if you don't have bun installed
git clone https://github.com/RajaRakoto/react-boilerplate
cd react-boilerplate
bun install # to install all dependencies
bun run pkg-upgrade # to upgrade outdated dependencies in interactive mode
```

> NOTE: I just use `bun` for performance reasons, you can use `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm`. [What is bun ?](https://bun.sh/)
> Similarly, for certain configurations in the package.json file, you need to modify them to tailor them to your project (e.g., name, description, author, keywords, main, repository, ...).
